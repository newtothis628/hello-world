Learning as I go

Hi All,

Essentially brand new to programming. I woked at a start up software company debugging programs in a pseudo javascript. I loved the work but hated the company. Have been learning to build responsive websites in HTML5 and CSS3 since leaving the company. Should have my first website up and running in the next two weeks, a small accomplishment, but I'm happy about it.

In my free time I read and pick things up and put them down:P
